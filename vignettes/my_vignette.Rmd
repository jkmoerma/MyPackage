This is a general overview of my package. The functions were written by lecturers of John Hopkins University. It was a exercise to document them and build an R package with them.

The functions are written in order to process information around traffic incidents in the USA. It provides:

* functions to support reading data in the offered format
* a function to report incident numbers
* a function to visualize spacial distribution of traffic incidents
