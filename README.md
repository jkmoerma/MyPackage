[![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/jkmoerma/MyPackage/graph/badge.svg)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/jkmoerma/MyPackage)

This package was built as the final assignment in the course "Building R packages" of Coursera. 
The functions included were built by the instructors of the course to give the students a start. 
The developed R-code is therefore not written by me. 
What was done by my hand was the documentation, the development of the R package and adding a CI check.
The token for this check can be found at the top of this README.md file.
