This package was built as the final asssignment in the course  "Building R packages" of Coursera.
The functions included were built by the instructors of the course to give the students a start.
The developed R-code is therefore not written by me.
What was done by my hand was the documentation, the development of the R package and adding a Linux compatibility web service called "Travis".
